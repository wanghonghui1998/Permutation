# Project 1: Permutation Generation

In this project, we research on the symmetry property of permutation generation algorithms, including Dictionary Order Method, Increasing Radix Method, Decreasing Radix Method and SJT Method.



## Files Tree

- **main.cpp**: main function of this program, generating all permutations given **n** and algorithm.

- **index2intermediate.cpp**(.hpp): generate intermediate number given index.

- **intermediate2perm.cpp**(.hpp): generate permutation given intermediate number, according to four algorithms

- **perm2next.cpp**(.hpp): generate permutations sequentially (w/o intermediate number) by Dictionary Order Method and SJT Method.

- **timing.cpp**(.hpp): analyse the cost of time of different algorithms and different **n**.

## Guideline

- Run the executable file

- Choose the algorithm

- Input  **n** 

- Get n! permutations generated by the specific algorithm and the runing time.
